# NeetCode 150 Solutions

## 📚 Overview

Dual-language (Python3 & Java) implementations of NeetCode 150 problems.

## 🗓️ Study Plan

- Week 1: Arrays & Hashing
- Week 2: Two Pointers & Sliding Window
- Week 3: Stack & Linked Lists
- Week 4-5: Trees & Graphs
- Week 6-7: Heap & Backtracking
- Week 8-10: Dynamic Programming

## Implementation Workflow

1. First Attempt (Python): Write intuitive solution
2. Optimize: Analyze time/space complexity, refine
3. Implement (Java): Translate to Java, noting syntax differences
4. Compare: Contrast Pythonic vs Java approaches
5. Document: Add comments explaining key insights
